## Variables 
Default value is undefined

Identifiers are case sensitive
can’t be a reserve keyword or start with number, no hyphen or space

Multiple variables can be declared in 1 statement but good modern practice is to have each variable in a new line.
let firstName = ‘its’;
let lastName = ‘0xRay’;

## Constants
Use when value or type(Arrays, Objects) should not be changed.
Cannot be reassigned. 
But you can change the elements of a constant array/properties of a constant object.
Data Types / Primitives
Number- 10,3.4
String- “Mango”
Boolean- true or false
Object - object, array, date
Undefined- not used commonly as it is the default value
Null- situations where we ask user to input, if nothing selected then null
BigInt- Large values 25345364561234242
Symbol

JS is Dynamic language. Declared variable types can change during run time.
Also there is no integer float etc. it is just numbers. 
The number variable can become string in run time

Reference Types
Objects, Array, Function

## Operators
Arithmetic: +,-,*,**,/%,++,--
Assignment: =
Comparison: ==,===,!=,!==,>,<,>=,<=
Logical: &&,||, !
Bitwise: &,|,~,^,<<,>>,>>>
Ternary/Conditional: ?
Type: typeof, ,instanceof

## Object
Are variables too. Contains many related values.
For example a car has make, model, type, color


How to Access? - objectName.propertyName

## Arrays
List of Objects
Data structure which represents a list of items

[]
Dynamic language so array length and type of objects can change

Array can have multiple types of data unlike other languages
